# Citi Bike Analysis 

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to compare Citi Bike statisics from New York City to compare to a potential location in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Data Used

The data that was used for these visualizations was downloaded from the Citi Bike website. It includes data from August 2019 that includes, trip duration, trip start and stop times, bike stations and their location by longitude and latitude, bike IDs, and gender.

The column that includes information on gender included information for both genders in one column. There was an equation used in tablaeu to split up gender information for more accurate visualizations.

## Findings

One of the most surprising findings, in my opinion, was the finding that around 75% of bike usage came from Citi bike subscribers. Meaning most customers are repeat customers and use the bikes regularly.

Based on the information, we can see that consistantly throughout the week, early hours between 7am-9am and again 5pm-7pm, are the highest points of bike utilization. We can make the assumption that is may be because users decide to use the bikes for commutes to and from work or school.

## Conclusion 

Based on the information found about NYC we can make a safe assumption that Citi Bike could be successful in Des Moines, Iowa especially if the station locations are located near high residential and commercial areas. It would need to be considered that bikes in areas of high usage would need to be monitored for maintenance more often.
